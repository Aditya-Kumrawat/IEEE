Problem Statement:
In the wake of increasing mental health challenges across diverse populations, individuals often lack access to timely, personalized, and clinically validated tools to monitor, manage, and improve their mental well-being. Traditional healthcare systems are overwhelmed, leaving gaps in emotional support, early detection, and intervention.
Current digital mental health solutions tend to be fragmented, lacking integration, personalization, and clinical depth. Moreover limited accessibility, and the absence of real-time support further hinder their effectiveness.
There is a pressing need for a secure, user-centric, and scientifically grounded mental health assessment and support platform that leverages modern technologies — such as AI, data visualization, and biometric tools — to empower individuals and healthcare providers alike.
